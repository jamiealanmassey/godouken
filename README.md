## What is Godouken?
**Godouken** is a lightweight, non-intrusive and integrated [GDScript](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html) API documentation tool for all your [Godot](https://godotengine.org) projects. The aim of the project is to make sharing documentation for your games as simple as possible, increasing the productivity of teams, and/or to serve as a reference for the single programmer.

### Features
- Tools to generate API documentation (based on script comments)
- Tools to export your API documentation to a HTML-based website
- Settings to customise your pages and documentation project
- Wholly integrated tool for Godot that lives inside of the editor

## Compiling Godouken
To use Godouken you must first have an understanding of how to compile Godot which you can read [here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/development/compiling/).  
  
The next step is to add Godouken to your engine's modules directory, and voila, you may now utilise the documentation tool in your projects!
